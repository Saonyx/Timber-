# Timber-
My first attempt at making a 2D game in C++ using the SFML Library.
Note: The purpose of this project was to learn about using SFML, and understanding the process of developing game code. My next project shall include making the code more presentable, and using more custom Header Files, and CPPs instead of using such a long Main Function.
